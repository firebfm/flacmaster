# flacmaster

This is my personal web scraping project. Input qq, apple or spotify url to scrape the tracklsit.
Then alter the tracklist by simplifying, removing brackets or sanitising illegal characters
Finally rename your music.

Note: please use obtain your own spotify id and secret

> Future to do list

- use tkinter to browse for a text file instead of hardcoding
- use threading or asyncio
- see if scrapy is faster
- get the cover art
